This plot shows the trend of the percentage of financial delegation as age growth and how individuals' percentage to delegate financial decisions differs in the US and SG. 
Both the green trend line (SG) and the blue trend line (US) exhibit a decrease in the likelihood of financial delegation as age grows, which shows a negative correlation between the age of participants and the percentage of medical delegation. For SG participants, the highest percentage in helping with financial delegation occurs from age 35-39 with 65.4% and the lowest percentage in helping with financial delegation occurs for age over 70 with 15.6%. For US participants, the highest percentage in helping with financial delegation occurs from age 30-34 with 51.2% and the lowest percentage in helping with financial delegation occurs from age 65-69 with 26.2%. 
Moreover, the percentage of financial delegation is higher in SG when participants have an age lower than 45 years old, once the age exceeds 45 years old, the percentage of financial delegation is higher in the US.

The green trend line represents the likelihood of financial delegating decisions that differ among Education levels for SG participants. The blue trend line represents the likelihood of financial delegating decisions that differ among Education levels for US participants. Both countries have an increasing trend, which means that the participant who has a higher education level (degree and above) might have a higher probability of helping with financial delegations. For education levels lower than high school, US participants have a higher percentage of helping with financial delegations about 20.6%. However, for participants who have a degree and above, SG participants have a higher percentage of helping with the financial delegation about 53.2%.

This plot shows the trend of the percentage of medical delegation as age grows and how individuals' percentage to delegate medical decisions differs in the US and SG. 
Both the green trend line (SG) and the blue trend line (US) exhibit a decrease in the likelihood of medical delegation as age grows, which shows a negative correlation between the age of participants and the percentage of medical delegation. For SG participants, the highest percentage in helping with medical delegation occurs from age 35-39 with 64.3% and the lowest percentage in helping with medical delegation occurs for age over 70 with 12.7%. For US participants, the highest percentage in helping with medical delegation occurs from age 30-34 with 51.4% and the lowest percentage in helping with medical delegation occurs from age 65-69 with 20.3%. 
Moreover, the percentage of medical delegation is higher in SG when participants have an age lower than 49 years old, once the age exceeds 49 years old, the percentage of medical delegation is higher in the US.

The green trend line represents the likelihood of medical delegating decisions that differ in Ethnicity between the Majority ("Chinese") and Underrepresented ("Malay", "Indian", "Eurasian") for SG participants. It has an increasing trend, which shows that SG participants who have Underrepresented Ethnicity ("Malay", "Indian", "Eurasian") might have a higher percentage of delegating in making medical decisions compared with SG participants whose Ethnicity is "Chinese".

It has a flat trend, which shows that US participants who have Underrepresented Ethnicity ("His/Lat", "Black", "Mixed", "Asian", "Others", or "Native") might have a similar percentage of delegating in making medical decisions compared with US participants whose Ethnicity is "White". s

This plot shows that based on the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with a range [0,1], how individuals' percentage to delegate medical decisions differ in the US and SG. 
Both the green trend line (SG) and the blue trend line (US) exhibit an increase in the likelihood of medical delegation as ADL scores increase, which shows a positive correlation between ADL scores and the percentage of medical delegation.
Moreover, with the same ADL score, the Percentage of Medical Delegation is higher in SG compared with the US. And as ADL scores closer to 1, the percentage of Medical Delegation in these two countries gets closer as well.

"1" = "<$30k", "2" = "$30k", "3" = "$50k", "4" = "$100k", "5" = "$150k", "6" = ">$200k"

This plot focuses on the significant predictor "income" in the US financial model. An increasing trend shows that as annual household income increases from <$30k to >$200k, the percentage of financial digital proxy increases as well, which means that the higher income a person has, the higher the probability he might help with financial proxy.
